    "abstract": "Various aspects of the laser cooling of atoms are investigated theoretically. More generally, the authors investigate a process through which the kinetic energy of a collection of resonant absorbers can be reduced by irradiating these absorbers with near-resonant electromagnetic radiation. The process is described here as anti-Stokes spontaneous Raman scattering. Cooling mechanisms, rates, and limits are discussed for both free and bound atoms.",
